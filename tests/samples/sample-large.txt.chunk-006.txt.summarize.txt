Sri Lanka has been facing a severe economic crisis, with the country's Prime Minister stating that its debt-laden economy has 'collapsed'. The country became the first in the Asia-Pacific region in decades to default on its foreign debt. Amidst the crisis, the country declared a food emergency due to a worsening forex crisis. Power cuts were reduced as rains began, but protests broke out with demonstrators breaking into the President's House. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa resigned and Ranil Wickremesinghe took oath as the new President. The country later cut policy rates to reduce inflation and boost economic recovery.
