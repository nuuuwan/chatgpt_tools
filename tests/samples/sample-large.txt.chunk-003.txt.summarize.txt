The Bandaranaike government of Sri Lanka in 1956 shifted from pro-western policies to recognizing Cuba under Fidel Castro. The country signed pacts with India in 1964 and 1974 to resolve disputes over plantation workers of Indian origin. Sri Lanka was heavily involved in the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and hosted its fifth summit in 1976. Relations with India became tense under the government of J. R. Jayawardene, leading to India's intervention in the Sri Lankan Civil War. Currently, Sri Lanka has strong relations with China, Russia, and Pakistan.

The Sri Lanka Armed Forces, including the Army, Navy, and Air Force, focus on internal security and have been mobilized for the last 30 years. They have also participated in UN peacekeeping operations.

Sri Lanka's economy is the second highest in South Asia in terms of per capita income. It was a plantation economy known for cinnamon, rubber, and tea production. From 1948 to 1977, the government followed socialist economic policies, but in 1977, it introduced a free market economy. The main economic sectors now are tourism, tea export, clothing, rice production, and other agricultural products.

Sri Lanka has an extensive road network and a state-run railway network. It also has three deep-water ports. In 2021, the country imposed a nationwide ban on inorganic fertilisers and pesticides, but later abandoned the plan due to rising food prices and protests.

Sri Lanka has a population of about 22 million people, with Sinhalese being the largest ethnic group. The two official languages are Sinhala and Tamil, and Buddhism is the largest religion. The country has a high literacy rate and mandates 9 years of compulsory schooling for every child.
